# STM32 LED Toggling Project

Welcome to the STM32 LED Toggling Project! This repository hosts an exciting assembly code venture designed to toggle the LEDs on your STM32 board.

## Quick Overview

In this project, you'll create a captivating LED display with the following features:

- **LED Toggling**: All 8 LEDs will toggle on and off in a loop. You can control their order easily.
- **Custom Delays**: Define the delay between LED toggles based on your preferences.
- **Repetitions**: Choose how many times the LED sequence should repeat.

## How It Works
- Two integers from the user are required. The first number toggles the 8-led in a cycle, while the second number changes the busy_delay function's delay
 between LEDs in accordance with the user-passed delay.
- **Toggle**: LEDs gracefully turn on, pause, and then turn off.
- **Delays**: Set the duration of on and off states.
- **Repeats**: It will repeat the cycle according to the first number from the user.
